I'm Naveen, I mostly do UI/UX Design and Front end development and working as a Freelancer, I really enjoy Learning Design thinking & Interaction design as well as in 
development side I work with core tech like HTML/CSS, and JavaScript but now I see myself more interested in React and Material design (MUI).
